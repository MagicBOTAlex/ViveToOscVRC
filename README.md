# Info
The reason you would want to this is FTB with base stations + Quest 2 full hand tracking in VRChat.
I need help with this project. Please contact me if you know how to use OSC trackers.

# Features
[x] Sends data through OSC to VRChat.
[] Calibration

# Problems
* The trackers are really far away. I don't know how to calibrate them for the Quest 2.
* Orientation. I again do not know how to calibrate this.

# How to build
1. Open project in VS2022 (I don't use vscode) <br>
2. Wait for nuget packages to be installed. <br>
3. Use VS2022 to build the project. <br>

# TODO
* Code orginization. (I just wanted a prototype as fast as possible)
* UI/CLI. (Currently only able to change IP and port through the source code)
